    "# 14. Longest Common Prefix\n",
    "Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.\\\n",
    "If there is no common prefix, return an empty string \"\".\n",

    "        - In Solution1 we began from the very beginning; if the shortest word was 4 letters long it would take potentially 4 loops to find. In this case we can begin from the 2nd letter and just require 2 loops.\n",

    "    - If the letters left match the prefixes of the other words, we can repeat this process with 1 less sliced letter. (potential prefix lengthened)\n",
    "    - If the letters left DO NOT match the prefixes of the other words, we can repeat this process with 1 more sliced letter. (potential prefix shortened)\n",
    "- We should repeat this process until our low and high value converge, meaning that `(low+high)//2` will give us the length of the longest common prefix.\n",
    "- This runs in O(log m * m * n) time when n is the sum of all characters in all strings and m is the number of strings, a potential improvement over Solution1.\n",
